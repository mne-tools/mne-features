- Extended feature naming to all univariate functions. If no specific function is implemented for a given univariate function and that the output has the same shape as the input on the feature dimension, then a generic list of feature names is passed. Possibility to rename these feature by passing ``ch_names`` to :func:`mne_features.extract_features`. By `Paul ROUJANSKY`_ in `#60 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-features/pull/60>`_.
- Added root mean square (RMS) and percentile univariate feature extraction functions. By `Hubert Banville`_ in `#61 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-features/pull/61>`_.
- Added ``log`` and ``ratios_triu`` to :func:`mne_features.univariate.compute_pow_freq_bands` to allow computing log-power and log-ratios of power and controlling whether all possible band ratios should be computed.  By `Hubert Banville`_ in `#62 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-features/pull/62>`_.
- Extended feature naming to all bivariate functions, with the same option to pass ``ch_names``  to :func:`mne_features.extract_features` as for univariate functions. By `Hubert Banville`_ in `#63 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-features/pull/63>`_.
- Change `log-power` values to *dB* (10 *log10*) in :func:`mne_features.univariate.compute_pow_freq_bands`. By `Thomas Fillon`_ in `#80 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-features/pull/80>`_.

Bug

- Fixed the behavior of the `edge` parameter in :func:`mne_features.univariate.compute_spect_edge_freq`. Valid values for this parameter are now `None` or a list of float between `0` and `1` (percentages). By `Jean-Baptiste SCHIRATTI`_ in `#52 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-features/pull/52>`_.
- Fixed channel name replacement with overlapping channel names (e.g., Cz and FCz) which affected :func:`mne_features.extract_features` with `return_as_df=True` and when `ch_names` are provided. By `Hubert Banville`_ in `#63 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-features/pull/63>`_.
- Fixed :class:`feature_extraction.FeatureFunctionTransformer`'s `check_input` method following sickit-learn 1.0 release: passing `reset=True`. By `Paul ROUJANSKY`_ in `#70 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-features/pull/70>`_.
- Fixed the value of normalized `log-power` values in :func:`mne_features.univariate.compute_pow_freq_bands`. Normalization by total power is now done before taking the log of the power value.  By `Thomas Fillon`_ in `#80 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-features/pull/80>`_.
